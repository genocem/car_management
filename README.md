# Car Management App

This is a personal summer project designed to help car owners manage their vehicles with ease. The app allows for tracking of car insurance, fuel consumption, and maintenance schedules for various car parts. Similar apps were too confusing and full of ads
## Features

- **Car Insurance Tracking**

- **Fuel Consumption Monitoring**

- **Maintenance Scheduler**

## Getting Started

**Simply Add Your Vehicle**: Enter relevant car details (such as the owner's name, vehicle registration number, or any identifier to recognize your car, along with the current kilometers (or mileage)). From there, you can add insurances, track maintenance needs based on kilometers or time, and monitor your spending on fuel as well as the distances you've traveled.

Thank you for checking out this project, it is still ongoing and is still far from completion. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!
